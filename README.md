A valuable tool that may be used to aid many biologists are gene co-expression networks (GCN). These networks can be used for differential co-expression analysis, where the differences in co-expression profiles of various sets of genes viewed in multiple contexts. In the case of various diseases, these analyses may aid in developing potential treatments as they can be used to infer potential diseases genes, which can then later be targeted. With the coding language R, both the Shiny and igraph packages will be used to build an interactive web application that will allow for network analysis based upon user input of total number of co-expression relationships, gene name, and context (estrogen receptors, p53, and grade).
